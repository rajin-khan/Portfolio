![Quiet, but Not Idle](/assets/images/posts/qbni2.png)

## I just noticed I hit 3,000+ GitHub contributions this year.

<div class="video-container">
  <video width="100%" poster="/assets/images/posts/qbni1.png" autoplay loop muted>
    <source src="/assets/videos/posts/qbni1.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</div>

And it hit me: **I've been building a lot, but sharing almost nothing.**

No demos. No stories. No breakdowns. No lessons. Just coding. **Quietly.**

And then I looked around and saw people with **half the experience** making **twice the impact**, just by showing their work.

That's not on them. **That's on me.**

## üë®‚Äçüíª **So, What Have I Actually Been Building?**

---

I've built a **lot** in just the past year. From **private video sync platforms**, **AI-powered note-taking apps**, **accessibility tools for the visually impaired**, **multi-agent AI chat systems**, to **shells in C**, **computer vision tools**, **homelabs**, **Telegram bots**, and a lot more.

But if you only looked at my socials, **you'd never know.**

### **The Problem with Building in Silence**

Here's the thing, I **love** building. I get lost in the process, the problem-solving, the late-night debugging sessions where everything finally clicks. But somewhere along the way, I convinced myself that the **work** was enough.

*It's not.*

Great work that nobody sees is just... work. Impact comes from sharing, teaching, and inspiring others along the way.

---

So, it's time to **change** that.

I'm going to start **showing my work**. I'll share what I'm learning. I'll talk through the weird, creative, useful things I'm building. Not for impressions, but rather **expressing myself**, because I love building, especially with the pressure of doing it **in public**.

And maybe to **inspire someone else to stop hiding too**.

### **What Can You Expect?**

If you're into:
- **AI** and machine learning experiments
- **Beautiful Design** that actually works
- **Nerdy Stuff** like self-hosting and homelabs
- **React Builds** (because why would you use anything else?)

Then **stick around**.

---

I'm not just talking about posting more on social media. I'm talking about:

- **Deep dives** into the projects I'm working on
- **Behind-the-scenes** looks at my development process  
- **Lessons learned** from both successes and spectacular failures
- **Open source** contributions and explanations
- **Tutorial content** for the tools and techniques I discover

### **Why Now?**

Because I've been **quiet**, but I sure as hell haven't been **idle**.

And if there's one thing I've learned from looking at those 3,000+ green squares on GitHub, it's that **consistency in building** is powerful. But **consistency in sharing** that building? That's where the real magic happens.

## ü•≥ **See You in the Next Post!**

This is just the beginning. I've got a backlog of projects to break down, stories to tell, and lessons to share.
